    "instructions": [
        "1. Reduce oven temperature to 300Β°F (148Β°C).",
        "2. In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese, sugar and flour on low speed until well completely combined and smooth. Be sure to use low speed to reduce the amount of air added to the batter, which can cause cracks. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.",
        "3. Add the sour cream and vanilla extract and mix on low speed until well combined.",
        "4. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing slowly to combine after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed to make sure everything is well combined.",
        "5. Pour the cheesecake batter into the crust.",
        "6. Place the springform pan inside another larger pan. Fill the outside pan with enough warm water to go about halfway up the sides of the springform pan. The water should not go above the top edge of the aluminum foil on the springform pan.",
        "7. Bake for 1 hour 15 minutes. The center should be set, but still jiggly.",
        "8. Turn off the oven and leave the door closed for 30 minutes. The cheesecake will continue to cook, but slowly begin to cool as well.",
        "9. Crack the door of the oven for 30 minutes to allow the cheesecake to continue to cool slowly. This process helps prevent cracking.",
        "10. Remove the cheesecake from the oven and water bath wrapping and refrigerate until firm, 5-6 hours or overnight.",
        "11. Remove the cheesecake from the springform pan and place on a serving dish. Refrigerate cheesecake until ready to serve.",
        "12. Serve with your favorite toppings. Cheesecake best for about 5 days."
